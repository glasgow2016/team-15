      "response1" : "Well done! Taking your headphones off means you can hear cars coming and you can cross the road safely.",
      "answer2" : "I keep my headphones on, look both ways and cross the road.",
      "response2" : "BEEP! A driver honked his horn. Remember to not listen to music because a car might come when you're not looking, so you need to use your ears to check that the road is safe too."

      "question": "You're almost at the cinema! The cinema is on the other side so you'll have to cross the road. Where do you cross?",
      "answer1" : "I'll cross in front of the bus because it's closer and I'll get there faster!",
      "response1" : "BEEP!!! A driver honked his horn. Remember to cross where you aren't hidden by vehicles like cars or buses.",
      "answer2" : "I'll walk a bit further to the zebra crossing.",
      "response2" : "Well done! Crossing at the zebra crossing means that drivers can see you and stop to let you go.",
